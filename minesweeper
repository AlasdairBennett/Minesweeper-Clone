        This is a two player variation of minesweeper.<br>
        The goal is to flag the most mines by the end of the game.<br>
        However, should you click a mine, you lose the game.<br>
        In the current iteration of the game, it's only playable as hotseat.<br>
        <br>
        Currently the first move is automatic for bad luck protection.<br>
        <br>
        Further note: this is confirmed not to work on safari.<br>
        If it isn't working for you, please use chrome!<br>
